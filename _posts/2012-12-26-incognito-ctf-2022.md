### Who am I?

We are just given @change_899. I checked twitter account on the wayback machine and found this <br>
<https://web.archive.org/web/20220410141256/https://twitter.com/change_899> <br>
Name: Lous Louis <br>
ictf{easy_osint_:-)}

### The Mission begins

Given: flag - ictf{yt_link_here} <br>

After searching name Lous Louis on youtube I found: <br>
ictf{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85q6kX5dSoY} <br>

### Can't login

Given: flag : ictf{ssh-key-password} <br>

In the youtube link from last challenge, there is a ssh key. <br>
Using image to text tools online I recreated the id_rsa file. <br>
I've uploaded it [here](https://github.com/Connor-McCartney/CTF-files/blob/main/ICTF-2022/id_rsa). <br>
Next create a hashfile using: <br>

```
python ssh2john.py id_rsa > hash
```

Now I tried cracking with johntheripper on my arch laptop. But I got error <br>
"SSH cipher value of 6 is not supported!" <br>
So I switched to my fedora laptop but also didn't work. I needed absolute latest version. <br>
So I followed fedora build instructions from source and cracked it using rockyou.txt after 15 minutes, <br>
giving flag{drummerboy}.
