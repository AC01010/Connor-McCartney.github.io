Hello! I will send you the flag in a second. Something funny happened though! I picked up my keyboard, but the keys were in weird places.
I don't know what happened, but it's okay since I stare at the keyboard anyways :)

Also I've had a crush on you for years, do you want to go out with me?
Anyways, here is the flag (hopefully): utflag{SubStiTuTIoN_cIPhEr_I_hArDLy_kNoW_hEr}
