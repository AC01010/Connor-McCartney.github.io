### Scrambled

We are given the following string of text (I added newlines then removed them to improve readability):

```python
x = """a[qjj7ahga2gc2jjg=qf/g.7xgm[qgpjo,g2fgog=q87f/tga=7vqm[2f,gpxff.g[o11qfq/

aj.a56af7aca5[aqua]3""".replace("\n","")
```

I started by doing frequency analysis:

```python
from collections import Counter

x = """a[qjj7ahga2gc2jjg=qf/g.7xgm[qgpjo,g2fgog=q87f/tga=7vqm[2f,gpxff.g[o11qfq/
gm[7x,[ahga2g1286q/gx1gv.g6q.n7ou/bgnxmgm[qg6q.=gcquqg2fgcq2u/g1jo8q=t3a2g/7f4m
g6f7cgc[omg[o11qfq/bgnxmg2m4=g76o.g=2f8qga2g=mouqgomgm[qg6q.n7ou/gof.co.=galay3
3aoj=7ga24-qg[o/gog8ux=[g7fg.7xgp7ug.qou=bg/7g.7xgcofmgm7g,7g7xmgc2m[gvqa0rrrrr
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr3aof.co.=bg[qu
qg2=gm[qgpjo,gai[71qpxjj.ayalgxmpjo,aza=xna=m2amxama27afa58a2a1[aqua5a2a5[aoua/
aj.a56af7aca5[aqua]3""".replace("\n","")

for letter, freq in Counter(x).items(): 
    print(letter, ":", freq) 
```

We see:

```
a : 40,   [ : 19,   q : 30,   j : 12,   7 : 22,   h : 2,   g : 62,   2 : 19,   c : 10,   
= : 16,   f : 18,   / : 12,   . : 16,   x : 14,   m : 21,   p : 6,   o : 23,   , : 6,   
8 : 6,   t : 2,   v : 3,   1 : 9,   6 : 7,   n : 5,   u : 12,   b : 4,   3 : 5,   4 : 3,   
l : 2,   y : 2,   - : 1,   0 : 1,   r : 70,   i : 1,   z : 1,   5 : 5,   ] : 1
```

g is by far the most common so I guessed it is a space and replaced it. <br>
I also know the flag is wrapped in {} which are rare characters and <br>
probably near the end of the message. ']' only occurs once, and is the <br>
second last character so it could be '}'. The second last character <br>
that only occurs once is 'z', so that could represent a '{'. <br>
An 'a' also comes before both of these, so it is likely shift, and <br>
I replaced it with a '~'.

```python
x = """a[qjj7ahga2gc2jjg=qf/g.7xgm[qgpjo,g2fgog=q87f/tga=7vqm[2f,gpxff.g[o11qfq/
gm[7x,[ahga2g1286q/gx1gv.g6q.n7ou/bgnxmgm[qg6q.=gcquqg2fgcq2u/g1jo8q=t3a2g/7f4m
g6f7cgc[omg[o11qfq/bgnxmg2m4=g76o.g=2f8qga2g=mouqgomgm[qg6q.n7ou/gof.co.=galay3
3aoj=7ga24-qg[o/gog8ux=[g7fg.7xgp7ug.qou=bg/7g.7xgcofmgm7g,7g7xmgc2m[gvqa0rrrrr
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr3aof.co.=bg[qu
qg2=gm[qgpjo,gai[71qpxjj.ayalgxmpjo,aza=xna=m2amxama27afa58a2a1[aqua5a2a5[aoua/
aj.a56af7aca5[aqua]3""".replace("\n","")

x = x.replace("g"," ").replace("a","~").replace("~]","}").replace("~z","{")

print(x)
```

We now have:

```
~[qjj7~h ~2 c2jj =qf/ .7x m[q pjo, 2f o =q87f/t ~=7vqm[2f, pxff. [o11qfq/

xmpjo,{~=xn~=m2~mx~m~27~f~58~2~1[~qu~5~2~5[~ou~/~j.~56~f7~c~5[~qu}3
```

Next I used the flag format utflag{} and replaced the characters <br>
preceding the '{'. xmpjo, -> utflag. I also removed the shift 
character for now but add it later:

```python
x = x.replace("g"," ").replace("a","~").replace("~]","}").replace("~z","{")
x = x.replace("x","U").replace("m","T").replace("p","F").replace("j","L")
x = x.replace("o","A").replace(",","G")

print(x.replace("~",""))
```

Now we have:

```
[qLL7h 2 c2LL =qf/ .7U T[q FLAG 2f A =q87f/t =7vqT[2fG FUff. [A11qfq/ 
T[7UG[h 2 1286q/ U1 v. 6q.n7Au/b nUT T[q 6q.= cquq 2f cq2u/ 1LA8q=t32

UTFLAG{=Un=T2TUT27f5821[qu525[Au/L.56f7c5[qu}3
```

Now we see the word flag appear twice more, and also the substring 'full' <br>
so I knew I was on the right track. I also saw the first word of the flag <br>
looked like it could be 'substitution'! giving more letters: <br>
=Un=T2TUT27f -> substitution

```python
x = x.replace("g"," ").replace("a","~").replace("~]","}").replace("~z","{")
x = x.replace("x","U").replace("m","T").replace("p","F").replace("j","L")
x = x.replace("o","A").replace(",","G").replace("=","S").replace("n","B")
x = x.replace("2","I").replace("7","O").replace("f","N")

print(x.replace("~",""))
```

We have:

```

From here it's mostly solved.


Final solution:

Hello! I will send you the flag in a second. Something funny happened though! I picked up my keyboard, but the keys were in weird places.
I don't know what happened, but it's okay since I stare at the keyboard anyways :)

Also I've had a crush on you for years, do you want to go out with me?
Anyways, here is the flag (hopefully): utflag{SubStiTuTIoN_cIPhEr_I_hArDLy_kNoW_hEr}
